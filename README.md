Overview

The SaySpider is a web crawler that is designed primarily to crawl [Tempest](http://www.saymedia.com/tempest) sites and identify SEO trouble areas. It is capable of crawling non-tempest sites, but has special functionality that is designed to make use of features that are unique to the Tempest site structure.

The crawler is based on [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) which is a python based web crawler.
